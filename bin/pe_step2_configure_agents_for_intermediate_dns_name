cat <<EOMESSAGE

The Puppet Master has been reconfigured to include class ${class} in all node
catalogs.  This class will reconfigure each agent to use the new, secure,
intermediate DNS name.  Once an agent receives this catalog and successfully
applies it, the node will be secured.

The remaining steps in the migration assistant will help you re-issue
certificates from a new Certificate Authority if you choose to do so.

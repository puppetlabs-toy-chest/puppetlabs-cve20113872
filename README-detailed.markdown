CVE-2011-3872 Remediation Toolkit -- Detailed Walkthrough
=========================================================

This module will help you permanently remediate the CVE-2011-3872 AltNames
vulnerability.

How the Vulnerability Works
---------------------------

Puppet agent identifies the puppet master by comparing the puppet master DNS
name it knows with the names in the master's certificate. The master's cert
can include both a primary name (Subject CN) and a set of alternate DNS names
(Subject Alternative Name).

Alternate DNS names are optional for master certs, and have to be specifically
enabled with the `certdnsnames` option. **In versions prior to 2.6.12 and
2.7.6, the Puppet CA will improperly insert any `certdnsnames` values into
_agent_ certificates as well as master certificates.** This bug was introduced
in Puppet 0.24.0.

This means that if the following two conditions are both met:

* Your puppet master has ever had its `certdnsnames` setting turned on during
  the current CA's lifetime
* Any of your agent nodes are configured to contact the master at a DNS
  alternative name that has ever been included in the `certdnsnames` setting

...then your site probably contains agent certificates that can impersonate
the puppet master in a man-in-the-middle attack.

**The threat posed by such certificates will persist even after upgrading to
an unaffected version of Puppet.** This module uses Puppet to help you to
quickly neutralize these certificates.

How the Fix Works
-----------------

Since two conditions must be true for your site to be vulnerable, you can
protect yourself by breaking either condition:

* If you configure all agent nodes to reach the master at a new, "clean" DNS
  name, they cannot be spoofed by rogue agent certs with the old DNS names.
* If you migrate all machines to a new CA which has never had `certdnsnames`
  turned on, every dangerous certificate will be invalidated.

This module can break both conditions of the vulnerability. 

**Steps 1 and 2** will secure your site immediately by configuring all agents
to use a new DNS name for the puppet master; they will also turn off the
`certdnsnames` setting if it isn't already deactivated.

**Steps 3 through 5** will provide long-term protection by migrating all
machines to a new CA. This will "clean" and restore your puppet master's
previous DNS name.

Repair Options
--------------

You have three main options for remediating the AltNames vulnerability.

1. If you have a **small-to-moderate number of nodes and can trivially SSH to
   all of them,** you can use a simpler remediation workflow. Disregard the rest
   of this guide and consult README-ssh-only.markdown.
2. If mass SSH is impractical and you **don't mind permanently changing the
   puppet master's DNS name,** you can protect yourself by running only the
   first two steps of this module. Continue reading for instructions, and stop
   after step 2.
3. If mass SSH is impractical and you **wish to continue using the current DNS
   name(s),** (or if you just want long-term protection against accidental reuse
   of the old names) you should run steps 1 through 5 of the remediation module.
   Continue reading for instructions.

Walkthrough
-----------

To remediate your site with this module, you must: 

* Stop adding new nodes
* Create a new temporary DNS entry for the puppet master
* Install the module
* Ensure that your modules will not interfere with the remediation
* Run steps 1 and 2 to secure your site
* Optionally, run steps 3 through 5 to "clean" the puppet master's previous DNS
  names

### Stop Adding New Nodes

You should not add nodes to your Puppet infrastructure during the remediation
of this vulnerability, as there is an increased chance of putting new nodes
into an "orphaned" state.

### Create a New DNS Entry for the Puppet Master

This module secures your site by configuring agents to contact the master at a
temporary (or permanent) new DNS name. Before it can do this, you must choose
a name yourself and edit your site's DNS configuration to point it at the
puppet master. Configuring DNS is beyond the scope of this document.

If your site's change-management policies do not allow timely modification of
DNS records, you can use Puppet itself to add a host entry on every agent
node. Simply add a host resource like the one below to your site.pp manifest
(outside of any node statements), and allow every agent to run once.

    host {'puppetmaster.new.domain.com':
      ensure  => present,
      ip      => '172.16.158.132',
      comment => 'Temporary puppet master hostname for remediating CVE-2011-3872'
    }

You may wish to log in to a few agent nodes and test that the new name
resolves correctly.

### Install the Module 

This module must be installed in Puppet's `modulepath` before you can use it.
If you have the puppet-module tool installed, you can run the following:

    cd /tmp
    wget http://links.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-cve20113872-0.0.1.tar.gz
    cd $(puppet master --configprint confdir)/modules
    puppet-module install /tmp/puppetlabs-cve20113872-0.0.1.tar.gz

If you're running an older version of the puppet-module tool, you may need to:

    mv puppetlabs-cve20113872 cve20113872

If you are not running the module-tool, you can simply unarchive the tarball,
rename the directory to `cve21003872`, and move it to your modules directory.

### Avoid Interference

This module makes changes to the following files on every puppet agent node: 

* The main puppet.conf configuration file
* The contents of Puppet's `ssldir` (run `puppet agent --configprint ssldir` to
  locate this directory)

If you are using Puppet to manage any of these files -- that is, managing
Puppet _with_ Puppet -- you **must** add a `noop => true` metaparameter to all
such resources until the remediation is complete. After the remediation, you
must ensure that your resources won't undo any permanent changes made by this
module before turning them back on.

### Step 1

This step:

* Turns off the master's `certdnsnames` setting, if it hasn't already been
  turned off.
* Issues a new certificate for the puppet master. This certificate will contain
  all of the previous DNS names for the puppet master, with the addition of a
  new DNS name of your choice.

This step modifies only the puppet master. You can perform the next step
immediately.

#### PE Users

From the top directory of this module, run the following:

    bin/pe_step1_enable_intermediate_dns_name <new DNS name>

#### Other users

TODO

#### Site status after running step 1:

- CA will create dangerous certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can be spoofed by agent certs? **YES.** (not fixed)
- Potentially dangerous certs are still valid? **YES.** (not fixed)
- Agents can operate normally and receive catalogs from master? **YES.**
  (business as usual)

### Step 2

This step: 

* Adds the `cve20113972::step2` class to all agent catalogs. This class:
    * Configures each agent node to contact the puppet master at the new DNS
      name.

This step modifies agent nodes. **All agent nodes must run once before
performing the next step.**

#### PE Users

From the top directory of this module, run the following:

    bin/pe_step2_configure_agents_for_intermediate_dns_name

#### Other Users

TODO

#### Checking agent status

This step is not complete until every agent node has run once. You can use
the included `check_progress` script to view a summary of your nodes' progress
through this step; simply run:

    bin/check_progress

...and check the percentage of nodes to have completed step 2.

#### Site status after running step 2:

After every agent node has checked in once:

- CA will create dangerous certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can be spoofed by agent certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Potentially dangerous certs are still valid? **YES.** (not fixed)
- Agents can operate normally and receive catalogs from master? **YES.**
  (business as usual)

**Your site is now protected.** However, all of the master's previous DNS
names are unsafe to use for the remaining lifetime of the CA. If you are
content to leave the puppet master on the new DNS name, you can stop now;
otherwise, continue to step 3.

**Schedule steps 3-5 carefully,** as step 4 entails a temporary disruption of
service.

**You should not run step 3 until all agents have run once and your full site
is protected.**

### Step 3

This step: 

* Generates a new CA certificate.
* Configures Puppet to sign any NEW certificate requests using the new CA.
* Prepares the puppet master to trust agent certificates from both the new and
  the old CA. 

This step modifies only the puppet master. You can perform the next step
immediately.

#### PE Users

From the top directory of this module, run the following:

    bin/pe_step3_generate_new_authority

#### Other Users

TODO

#### Site status after running step 3:

- CA will create dangerous certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can be spoofed by agent certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Potentially dangerous certs are still valid? **YES.** (not fixed)
- Agents can operate normally and receive catalogs from master? **YES.**
  (business as usual)

### Step 4

This step:

* Adds the `cve20113972::step2` class to all agent catalogs. This class:
    * Moves the agent's `ssldir` to a backup location.
    * Securely configures the agent to trust the new CA (and _only_ the new CA).
    * Configures the agent to contact the master at its old DNS name
    * Restarts puppet agent.
    * Submits a new certificate signing request.

This step modifies agent nodes. **All agent nodes must run once before
performing the next step.**

#### PE Users

From the top directory of this module, run the following:

    bin/pe_step4_migrate_agents_to_new_authority

#### Other Users

TODO

#### Checking agent status

This step is not complete until every agent node has run once. You can use
the included `check_progress` script to view a summary of your nodes' progress
through this step; simply run:

    bin/check_progress

...and check the percentage of nodes to have completed step 4.

#### Site status after running step 4:

After every agent node has checked in once:

- CA will create dangerous certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can be spoofed by agent certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Potentially dangerous certs are still valid? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can operate normally and receive catalogs from master? **NO.**
  (disruption of service)

**The puppet master's previous DNS names have been rehabilitated,** and are
safe to use in the future; accordingly, this step restores the agent's
configuration so it will use the previous name.

**Note that agent nodes which have run a step 4 catalog will be unable to
retrieve and run their normal catalogs until the end of step 5.**

**You should not run step 5 until all agents have run once.** If you run step
5 too early, any agents who have not run their step 4 catalogs **will be in an
"orphaned" state** and must be repaired manually. Use the included status tool
<!-- TODO --> to check whether your entire population has been migrated to the
new CA.

Orphaned nodes can be repaired by logging in, moving the `ssldir` to a new
location, and restarting puppet agent. Run `puppet agent --configprint ssldir`
to locate the `ssldir`.

### Step 5

This step: 

* Cleans out the puppet master's certificate from the old CA.
* Issues the master a certificate signed by the new CA. 
* Configures the master to distrust agent certificates from the old CA.

This step modifies only the puppet master.

#### PE Users

From the top directory of this module, run the following:

    bin/pe_step5_migrate_the_master

#### Other Users

TODO

#### Site status after running step 5:

After every agent node has checked in once:

- CA will create dangerous certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can be spoofed by agent certs? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Potentially dangerous certs are still valid? **NO.** (fixed!)
- Agents can operate normally and receive catalogs from master? **YES.**
  (service has resumed)

This step completes the full remediation. 

**You must still sign any pending certificate signing requests** to reenable
normal agent traffic -- if you don't use autosign, you should manually sign
these requests with the `puppet cert --list` and `puppet cert --sign`
commands. (If you recognize every certname in the list of CSRs and are
confident that none were submitted by malicious nodes, you may wish to use
`puppet cert --sign --all`.)
